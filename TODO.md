- Figure out the datasets to use for LMs (GSM8k Sentiment Analysis, Machine Translation ,etc, ...)
- Figure out model to use (BERT, LLAMA, etc.)
- Decide on Pre-processing functions to use (Use model tokenizer for all datasets)
- Implement LoRA/PEFT finetuning for Language Models
- Make a Language Model class in modelling.py (linearize and all can be called later)
